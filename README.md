# SMOOTH

Smooth is a tool that will sort files based on the strategy picked. 
The goal behind Smooth is to learn stuff, compare strengths and weaknesses of multiple programming languages.

Test out Visual Studio Code editor 

Also I have not found a real simple image sorting utility that just works.  Move images off my camera, phones and other drives and drop them in the year the photo was taken.

End result will be the same utility built out in many languages including DotNetCore, node, GO and Python, etc..



# Install
....

 
##  dotnetcore


### Usage
#### help
smooth -h

#### Stage option run through it and output the results without moving files
smooth I:\DCIM\100D5000\ 'G:\My Pictures\' -s

####  Strategy - The strategy used.  "year" will bucket files by year in destination folder.
smooth I:\DCIM\100D5000\ 'G:\My Pictures\' year

Here's a glimpse of Projectile in action:
