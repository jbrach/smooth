    End result will be a similar utility built out in many languages including DotNetCore, node, GO and Python

### Usage
smooth -h
### Project setup  
I started by figuring out how to reference projects.  Required some digging into how  "dotnet build" command uses the Project.json and global.json for references.  The Visual Code Documentation is not great but found a simple example http://www.natemcmaster.com/blog/2016/03/29/project-json/ to get me started.

### Client
Built the first console client
