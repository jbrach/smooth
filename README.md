Smooth is a tool that will sort files based on the strategy picked.
The goal behind Smooth is to learn stuff, compare strengths and weaknesses of multiple programming languages.

Also I have not found a real simple image sorting utility that just works.  I am creating utility that will quickly move images off of cameras, phones and other drives how I want it while learning.

## Install
